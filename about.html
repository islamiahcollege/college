               <p class="about__description">
                  The Muslims of Vaniyambadi established the Vaniyambadi Muslim Educational Society in 1901 with a view
                  to translate the message of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan to provide secular education to the people of Arcot
                  region in general and Muslims in particular. The Society was registered in 1905 under Society
                  Registration Act XXI of 1860 and started Islamiah Elementary School in 1903.The founding fathers of
                  the Society were Janab T.Hajee Badruddin Sahib, Janab Malang Hayath Batcha Sahib, Janab T. Ameenuddin
                  Sahib and Janab Malang Ahmed Batcha Sahib. The full-fledged Islamiah High School came into existence
                  in 1912. In 1916, the Society resolved to establish Islamiah College and the foundation stone of the
                  College was laid by His Excellency Lord Pentland, the then Governor of Madras Presidency. With
                  princely donations from the Muslim philanthropists, the College was started in 1919 and got
                  recognition from July 1921. The building in which the College is housed at present was opened by Nawab
                  C.Abdul Hakeem Sahib who gave a munificent donation of Rs. 50,000 to the Society.

                  In 1946, the College was upgraded as a Degree College offering two year degree courses in B.A
                  Economics and B.Com. In 1954, B.A Group1(b) Mathematics was started. In 1956, the College got
                  affiliation for the Pre-university and the three year degree courses, B.A., B.Sc., and B.Com., were
                  started in 1957. The University accorded permission to start B.Sc. Zoology and B.A. History in 1967.
                  M.A. History was started in 1974, M.Com. in 1975, and M.Sc. Mathematics in 1976.

                  Consequent upon the shedding of the Pre-university Course with effect from 1979, the College offers
                  instructions for Degree and Postgraduate Courses only. The College has further introduced new courses
                  like B.Sc. Branch III Physics Major in 1981-82 and B.A. Branch XV Corporate Secretaryship in 1982-83
                  and in the year 1983-84, the College got affiliation in B.A. Industrial Organisation (Leather), a
                  rural-based job-oriented course proposed by the College and approved by the University. B.Sc. Branch
                  XI Biochemistry was started in 1985-86. The College has been recognised as a research institution for
                  Ph.D. in Commerce from the academic year 1986-87. During 1986-87, the College further introduced
                  M.Phil. Course (Full Time) in Commerce and M.Sc. Chemistry under aided stream. The College got
                  affiliation for M.Phil. (Part time) in Mathematics and B.Sc. Computer Science in 1988-89 and for
                  M.Phil. (Part Time) in History in 1993-94 and Ph.D. in History in 1996.

                  The College got affiliation for M.Sc. Biochemistry in the year 1998-99 under self-financing scheme.
                  The College has introduced M.Sc. Computer Science during 1999-2000 under self-financing scheme. The
                  College got affiliation for M.Phil. (Full Time) Mathematics in 2000-01.

                  The College has introduced UGC supported vocational subject Biotechnology in the year 2001-02 under
                  B.Sc. Degree (Non-Semester) courses in Biochemistry, Chemistry and Zoology. Consequent to the
                  establishment of Thiruvalluvar University, our College has been affiliated to this new University from
                  the academic year 2003-04.

                  The College had a humble beginning in 1919 has now grown up to a full-fledged P.G. and Research
                  Institution catering to the needs of the rural lot who would have otherwise not dreamt of taking a
                  Research Degree. Now the Management has come forward to introduce new courses in the Evening College.

                  The College has started functioning as Day College (Shift I) and Evening College (Shift II) from the
                  month of August 1999. The Evening College offers Self-Financing courses in M.Sc. Physics, M.Sc.
                  Computer Science and B.C.A., and thus the College is bound to expand by leaps and bounds and is
                  destined to take a great leap forward in the new courses (Both Aided and Self-Financing).

                  M.Phil. (Chemistry) and B.C.A. Computer Applications were started in 2000, Ph.D. Chemistry and
                  Mathematics in 2005, M.Phil. Physics in 2007, M.Phil. Biochemistry in 2009, B.A. English Literature,
                  M.A. English Literature, M.Sc. Biotechnology and Ph.D. in Physics in 2010. Ph.D in Biotechnology and
                  Biochemistry were started from the academic year 2013-14 and 2016-17 respectively. B.Sc. Data Science
                  Programme has been introduced from 2022-23.

                  The College has earned for Vaniyambadi a place in the educational map of India. It is located amidst
                  green fields and wide spaces presenting a natural environment. Its well-ventilated, spacious lecture
                  halls, well-equipped laboratories and good library, Dr. Allama Iqbal Auditorium and the imposing
                  two-storeyed Malang Endowment Hostel speak volumes for the interest of the Muslim Community of
                  Vaniyambadi in providing facilities for higher education. The College has been Accredited by NAAC with
                  the highest Grade of "A++" in its 3rd Cycle for 7 years from 21.03.2024 to 20.03.2031, after
                  consistently securing "A" Grade in its first two cycles of Assessment. By the grace of Almighty, the
                  University Grants Commission, New Delhi has extended the Autonomous Status to the College for a period
                  of 10 years from 2022-23 to 2031-32
